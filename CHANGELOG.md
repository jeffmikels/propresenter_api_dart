## 0.2.0

-   Improved type responses for 7.9 api wrapper calls.

## 0.1.0

Initial version. It's currently a copy of the code I'm using for my Flutter app `ProP Advanced` modified for null safety and refactored a bit.
However, this version also contains a set of Dart functions generated directly from the new 7.9+ API documentation.
